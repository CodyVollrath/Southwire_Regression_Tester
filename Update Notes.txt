Chance Added:
If SCH06 is populated in the original 846, then it must be populated in the new 846. Donâ€™t compare the data in SCH06, only that it is populated.

If SCH06 is empty in the original 846, then it must be empty in the new 846.
There will be two SCH06 elements we will be dealing with, SCH06_1 & SCH06_2
