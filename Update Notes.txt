Updates: 
 Added the ability to distinguish delimiters automatically
 
 Added the ability to identify SCH and DTM segments when the
 ignore envelope check box is checked

When DTM and SCH documents are identified, the SCH06 and DTM02 will be 
compared only when they one of the two that are being compared is empty or populated. 

So if SCH06_1 is empty but SCH06_2 is populated it will flag as a mismatch and vice versa (This applies to DTM02 as well)
